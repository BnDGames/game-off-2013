##### HOW TO PLAY (since I didn't have time to add an in-game tutorial :) )

When first launching the game, you will have to create your ship: open the ship editor and do it, NOW! (and if you can't understand what's going on just jump to the SHIP EDITOR section of this readme, some paragraphs below...)

Once done that, just click the big PLAY button in the main menu and kill a bunch of those annoying enemies. Use WASD (or arrow keys) to drive your ship, use SPACE to shoot and B,N,D keys to choose LIGHT, MEDIUM and HEAVY ship states.

When you lose, you can use your score to buy new parts in the store and build a better ship.

##### THE SHIP EDITOR

Drag the parts from the slots on the right onto your ship to add them. To remove a part from the ship, just click on it. To change ship state, click on the state buttons below the ship. Hover over a part to see its description in the box below.
